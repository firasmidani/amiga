            if None: user is interested in reading one or more data files (so user must pass directory argument).

            if dictionary: Keys are folder names, values are their paths. Keys must include 'data' and 'derived'
                'data' sub-folder must exist and house one or more data files to be read. 
            if str: path to folder that houses one ore more data files to be read.
            if None: user is interested in reading a single data file (so user must pass filename argument).
        interval (dictionary or numeric):
            if numeric: must be int or float.
            if dictionary: Keys are file names, values are their respective interval parameter, e.g. 
                {'CD2015_PM1-1':600,'CD2048_PM1-1':900}). If a filename does not have a corresponding key in the
