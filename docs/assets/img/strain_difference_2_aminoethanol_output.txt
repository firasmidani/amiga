The following criteria were used to subset data:
Substrate......['2-Aminoethanol']

The following hypothesis was test on the data:
{'H0': ['Time'], 'H1': ['Time', 'Strain']}

log Bayes Factor: 596.548 (0.0-percentile in null distribution based on 100 permutations)

For P(H1|D) > P(H0|D) and FDR <= 20%, log BF must be > 0.024
For P(H0|D) > P(H1|D) and FDR <= 20%, log BF must be < -5.61e-05

Data Manipulation: Input was reduced to 34 time points. Samples were normalized to relevant control samples before modelling.
