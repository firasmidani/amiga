### What is AMiGA?

It is a python-based program for high-throughput analysis of microbial growth data sets that are typically generated by multi-well plate readers. It applies Gaussian Process (GP<a></a>) inference to estimate microbial growth parameters such as maximum specific growth time, doubling time, lag phase, and carrying capacity. It is also the first growth curve-fitting program that can objectively detect and describe diauxic shifts in growth data. Finally, it is especially useful for the rapid analysis of Biolog Phenotypic Microarray (PM<a></a>) data.
<br /><br />

### Why use AMiGA?

Many microbial growth curves do not follow standard logistic or sigmoidal shapes. Gaussian Processes have recently been shown as a useful model for fitting these growth curves and inferring growth parameters (Swain et *al.* 2016; Tonner et *al.* 2017<a></a>). AMiGA is the first program to analyze microbial growth data using GP inference in a user-friendly fashion. In order to plot or analyze the data, users simply interact with AMiGA using the command line by pointing to the file of interest. User can pass additional arguments or files or define program-specific parameters for more sophisticated analysis.
<br /><br />

### What can AMiGA do for you?

It can do the following:
- Plot the growth curves for 96-well plates.
- Summarize growth curves with basic metrics such as maximum optical density or fold-change relative to control well\(s<a></a>).
- Infer growth curve kinetic parameters such as growth lag, maximum specific growth rate, doubling time, or area under the curve.
- Detect diauxic shifts and identify the time at which these shifts occur.
- Perform hypothesis-driven statistical testing of differences in microbial growth under different experimental conditions.
