In `AMiGA`, you can analyze a single file or multiple files in a single command. To analyze a single file, simply point to it directly with the `--i` or `--input` arguments

```bash
amiga fit -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/data/ER1_PM2-1.txt
```

Bug if you want to analyze multiple files, simply deposit them in the `data` folder and point `AMiGA` to the working directory.

```bash
amiga fit -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment
```
