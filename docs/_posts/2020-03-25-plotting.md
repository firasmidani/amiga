### Summarizing and Plotting a 96-well plate

<br />

Let us assume that my working directory is

```bash
/Users/firasmidani/experiment
```

<br />

and I stored my plate reader file in the `data` sub-folder

```bash
/Users/firasmidani/experiment/data/ER1_PM2-1.txt
```

<br />

First, make sure that you are inside the `AMiGA` directory

```bash
cd /Users/firasmidani/amiga
```

<br />

Second, if you simply would like to plot the raw data in a 96-well grid, you can run the following:

```bash
python main.py -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/data/ER1_PM2-1.txt --only-basic-summary
```

- `-i` or `--input` argument will point to the location of the file of interest<br/>
- `--only-basic-summary` tells `AMiGA` to plot the plate, summarize basic metrics of each curve, and save both.<br />

<br />

**Plot Output**

In your `/Users/firasmidani/experiment/figures` folder, you will find `ER1_PM2-1.pdf`.

<br /><br />

<br /><br />

This example shows a Biolog PM2 plate where the A1 well is a negative control well (no carbon substrate). `AMiGA` computed the fold-change for all wells relative to the negative control well. Fold-change is computed as maximum change in OD in each well relative to the fist time point divided by the maximum change in OD in the control well relative to the first time point. The numbers on the top right of each plot is the raw maximum OD in each curve. `AMiGA` highlighted wells where the fold-change is higher than 1.5 in blue or lower than 0.5 in red. If you want to change the default values for these thresholds, choice of colors, or y-axis label, you can make changes these parameters in `amiga/config.py` file.

<br /><br />

**Summary Output**

In addition to the plot, `AMiGA` summarizes the following basic metrics for all growth curves and records these metrics as tables in the `summary` folder where you will find `ER1_PM2-1.txt`.

|Metric|Description|
|:---|:---|
|OD_Baseline|The OD measurement at the first time point|
|OD_Min|The minimum OD measurement at any time points|
|OD_Max|The maximum OD measurement at any time points|
|Fold_Change|defined as the ratio of change in OD of the case (or treatment) growth curve relative to change in OD of the control growth curve|

### Summarizing and Plotting multiple 96-well plates with a single command

This is super easy. Just point `AMiGA` to the working directory and include the `--only-basic-summary` argument. `AMiGA` will find all of the data files, plot them, and save the figures as PDFs in the `figures` folder.

```bash
python main.py -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment --only-basic-summary
```
