####  AMiGA can summarize and plot a 96-well plate

<br />

Let us assume that my working directory is

```bash
/Users/firasmidani/experiment
```

<br />

and I stored my plate reader file in the `data` sub-folder

```bash
/Users/firasmidani/experiment/data/ER1_PM2-1.txt
```

<br />

First, make sure that you are inside the `AMiGA` directory

```bash
cd /Users/firasmidani/amiga
```

<br />

Second, if you simply would like to plot the raw data in a 96-well grid, you can run the following:

```bash
python amiga.py summarize -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/data/ER1_PM2-1.txt
```

- `summarize` tells `AMiGA` to plot the plate, summarize basic metrics of each curve, and save both.<br />
- `-i` or `--input` argument will point to the location of the file of interest<br/>


<br />

#### Typical plot output

In your `/Users/firasmidani/experiment/figures` folder, you will find `ER1_PM2-1.pdf`.

<br /><br />

![example_96_well_plot](../assets/img/example_plot.png){:class="img-responsive"}

<br /><br />

This example shows a Biolog PM2 plate where the A1 well is a negative control well (no carbon substrate). `AMiGA` computed the fold-change for all wells relative to the negative control well. Fold-change is computed as maximum change in OD in each well relative to the first time point divided by the maximum change in OD in the control well relative to the first time point. The numbers on the top right of each plot is the raw maximum OD in each curve. `AMiGA` highlighted wells where the fold-change is higher than 1.5 in blue or lower than 0.5 in red. If you want to change the default values for these thresholds, choice of colors, or y-axis label, you can make changes these parameters in `amiga/config.py` file. Color highlighting is only applicable if 

<br /><br />

#### Typical summary output

In addition to the plot, `AMiGA` summarizes the following basic metrics for all growth curves and records these metrics as tables in the `summary` folder where you will find `ER1_PM2-1.txt`.

|Metric|Description|
|:---|:---|
|OD_Baseline|The OD measurement at the first time point|
|OD_Min|The minimum OD measurement at any time point|
|OD_Max|The maximum OD measurement at any time point|
|Fold_Change|defined as the ratio of change in OD of the case (or treatment) growth curve relative to change in OD of the control growth curve|

<br />

Here, fold change is mathematically defined as

$$\text{Fold Change}  = \frac{ \displaystyle \max \text{OD}_{\text{case}}(t)- \text{OD}_{\text{case}}(0)}{ \displaystyle \max \text{OD}_{\text{control}}(t) - \text{OD}_{\text{control}}(0)} \quad \text{where} \quad $$

<br />

#### How to summarize multiple 96-well plates with a single command?

This is super easy. Just point `AMiGA` to the working directory instead of an individual file. `AMiGA` will find all of the data files, plot them, and save the figures as PDFs in the `figures` folder, and save summary tables in the `summary` folder.

```bash
python amiga.py summarize -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment
```

<br />

If you would like one single summary file for multiple plates, you should include the `--merge-summary` argument and also add the `-o` argument for naming the output file. 

```bash
python amiga.py summarize -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment --merge-summary -o all_summary_tables
```
This will save a single summary file named `all_summary_tables_basic.txt`. If you do not pass an `-o` argument, `AMiGA` will name the file using a unique time stamp.
