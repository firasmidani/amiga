Let us assume that my working directory is

`/Users/firasmidani/experiment`

and I stored my plate reader file in the `data` sub-folder

`/Users/firasmidani/experiment/data/PRB951_PM1-1.asc`

Make sure that you are inside the `AMiGA` directory

```bash
cd /Users/firasmidani/amiga
```

If you simply would like to plot the raw data in a 96-well grid, you can run the following:

```bash
python main.py -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/data/PRB951_PM1-1.asc --only-plot-plate
```

In your `/Users/firasmidani/experiment/figures` folder, you will find `PRB951_PM1-1.pdf`
