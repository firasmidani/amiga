`AMiGA` can model growth curves as Gaussian Processes (GPs) and use the GP fits to estimate growth parameters.

First, `AMiGA` will compute the following metrics for all growth curves:

|Metric|Description|
|:---|:---|
|OD_Baseline|The OD measurement at the first time point|
|OD_Min|The minimum OD measurement at any time points|
|OD_Max|The maximum OD measurement at any time points|
|Fold_Change|defined as the ratio of change in OD of the treatment growth curve relative to change in OD of the control growth curve|

$$
\begin{flalign}
\text{Fold Change}  = \frac{OD_{Max}^{Treatment} - OD_{Baseline}^{Treatment}}{OD_{Max}^{Control} - OD_{Baseline}^{Control}}
\end{flalign}
$$

 Second, `AMiGA` will apply the following transformations to you data:

1. Conversion of time units (e.g. from seconds to hours). Choice of units is defined in `amiga\libs\config.py`.
2. Natural logarithmic transformation (i.e. OD --> ln(OD))
3. Subtract the initial ln(OD) measurement from all subsequent ln(OD) measurements (i.e. normalizes data to the first time point such that growth curves always start at 1).

Finally, using the GP fit, `AMiGA` will estimate the following growth parameters:

|Parameter|Description|
|:---|:---|
|auc|Area Under the curve|
|k|Carrying capacity|
|gr|Maximum specific growth rate|
|dr|Maximum specific death rate|
|td|Doubling time|
|lag|Lag time|
|diauxie|Diauxic shift (true or false)|
|t_peak_n|The time-points at which the `nth` growth phase is centered (i.e. growth is locally maximal)|
