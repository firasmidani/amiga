You can use `AMiGA` to analyze only specific wells even if they are spread across different plates. To do this, you can utilize `AMiGA` subsetting function. Here are a couple examples that will explain how to do this.

<br />

**Example One**

You have 100s of files in your data folder. But you only want to analyze wells corresponding to two specific isolates.

```bash
python main.py -i /Users/firasmidani/experiments -s 'Isolate:CD_treA,CD_treX' --merge-summary.
```

The subsetting argument above assumes that the relevant mapping files will have the `Isolate` column. This can be auto-generated by `AMiGA` for Biolog plates that are correctly named for `AMiGA` to recognize them. If you are not analyzing `Biolog` plates, you will have to pass a mapping or `mapping\meta.txt` file to communicate with `AMiGA`. See [Preparing Metadata](/amiga/doc/_posts/2020-03-25-metadata.md) for more details.

The proper syntax for the argument is to define the variable of interest (`Isolate`) followed by a colon (`:`) followed by the values of the variable of interest separated by commmas (`,`).

If you invoke the `--merge-summary` argument, the results are merged into a single file with a name that includes a time tamp `summary_{Year}-{Month}-{Day}_{Hour}-{Minutes}-{Seconds}.txt`. If you do not invoke the argument (by default), `AMiGA` would summarize results one plate at a time and will record one summary file per plate. These files would over-ride previously save files in the `summary` folder.

<br />

**Example Two**

Same as above but you also  want to analyze these isolates when only grown on a select set of substrates.

```bash
python main.py -i /Users/firasmidani/experiments -s 'Isolate:CD_treA,CD_treX;Substrate:alpha-D-glucose,D-fructose,D-trehalose'
```

If you are selecting on more than a single variable, you must separate your selections with a semi-colon (';').

<br />

**Example Three**

You have many files in your `data` folder and you pass meta-data to `AMiGA` using individual mapping and `mapping\meta.txt` file. You have included additional unique variables in your mapping files that you will use for subsetting below.

```bash
python main.py -i /Users/firasmidani/experiments -s 'Isolate:CD_treA,CD_treX;Substrate:alpha-D-glucose,D-fructose,D-trehalose;Antibiotics:None,clindamycin'
```

<br />

**Example Four**

In the subsetting argument, `AMiGA` will ignore whitespaces that flank delimiters (`,`,`:`,or `;`) so the below command should also work. It may be more aesthetically pleasing for some.

```bash
python main.py -i /Users/firasmidani/experiments -s 'Isolate : CD_treA , CD_treX ; Substrate : alpha-D-glucose , D-fructose , D-trehalose ; Antibiotics : None , clindamycin'
```

<br />

**Example Five**

You can also specify wells that should not be analyzed. This can only be applied if you point to well locations in specific plates.

```bash
python main.py -i /Users/firasmidani/experiments --f 'CD_treA.txt:G7,H12;ER1_PM2-1:C3,C4,C5'
```

This is often useful if you noticed, by visual checking plots, that certain wells did not show any growth or showed odd measurements (e.g. gas bubbles can cause sharp spikes in OD measurements).
