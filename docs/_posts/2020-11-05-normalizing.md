#### What is normalization?

In a typical analysis, researchers have control samples which indicate the expected behavior under known conditions. A typical negative control may be the growth of an isolate on blank media (i.e. low or no growth) and a typical positive control may be the growth on a preferred susbtrate (e.g. glucose). 

When testing the growth of an isolate on a new condition, it often helps to compare it to other known conditions especially negative or positive controls. `AMiGA` has the normalization function which simplifies this process for the user. Normalization can be performed by either subtracting the the growth paameters of control sample(s) from the treatment samples, or by dividing the growth parameters of the treatment samples from the control sample(s). 

Normalization by subtration will result in values that are centered around zero which would indicate no difference from the control samples, for example,

$$\text{Normalized AUC} = \text{AUC}(\text{Isolate on Substrate}) - \text{AUC}(\text{Isolate on Blank Media})$$

while normalization by dividion will result in values that are centered around 1 which would indicate no difference fom the control samples, for example, 

$$\text{Normalized AUC} = \frac{\text{AUC}(\text{Isolate on Substrate})}{\text{AUC}(\text{Isolate on Blank Media})}$$

#### How to normalize growth parameters?

After modelling growth curves and estimating growth parameters using the `fit` function, users can adjust the estimated growth parameters with the `normalize` function. To properly normalize data, the users must indicate in their meta-data how samples are grouped and which samples are considered the control samples in each group. For example, all 96 wells belong to the same group because they are inoculated by the same cell culture and the `A1` well is the `Negative Control` well. As previously shown, `AMiGA` automatically adds a `Group` and `Control` column in the meta-data for Biolog PM plates to streamline this normalization. 

**Example 1**

As an example, let us assume that we profiled an isolate with two replicate plates of Biolog PM1

```bash
amiga fit -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/ -o split_merged
```

<br />
This would have generated the following `split_merged_summary.txt` table

|Well_ID|Plate_ID|Isolate|Substrate|Group|Control|auc_lin|...|t_gr|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|A1|erand_PM1-1|erand|None|1|1|0.21|...|4.4|
|B1|erand_PM1-1|erand|L-Arabinose|1|0|0.85|...|4.1|
|C1|erand_PM1-1|erand|N-Acetyl-D-Gluosamine|1|0|0.83|...|4.0|
|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|
|F12|erand_PM1-1|erand|Inosine|1|0|0.23|...|4.5|
|G12|erand_PM1-1|erand|L-Malic Acid|1|0|0.33|...|3.8|
|H12|erand_PM1-1|erand|2-Aminoethanol|1|0|0.68|...|4.0|
|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|
|A1|erand_PM1-2|erand|None|2|1|0.22|...|4.5|
|B1|erand_PM1-2|erand|L-Arabinose|2|0|0.85|...|4.0|
|C1|erand_PM1-2|erand|N-Acetyl-D-Gluosamine|2|0|0.83|...|3.9|
|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|
|F12|erand_PM1-2|erand|Inosine|2|0|0.19|...|4.6|
|G12|erand_PM1-2|erand|L-Malic Acid|2|0|0.29|...|3.9|
|H12|erand_PM1-2|erand|2-Aminoethanol|2|0|0.72|...|4.0|

<br />
We can adjust the growth paarmeters by simply using the `normalize` function.

```bash
amiga normalize -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/summary/split_merged -o "new_normalized" --normalize-method "division"
```          
- `-i` points to the summary file generated by the `fit` function.
- `-o` allows the user to pick the name for the new summary table. If the user does not pass the `-o` arugment, `AMiGA` will create a new file with a `_normalized` suffix, for example, `split_merged_normalized.txt`. If the user wants to replace the file with a new version that includes normalized parameters, they must add the `--over-write` argument. 
- `--normalize-method` specifies that the user wants to adjust the growth parameters by `division`. The user user can instead opt for `subtraction` which is the default option.

<br />

However, you can also run the above command more explicitly if you did not have the `Group` and `Control` columns in the data. 


```bash
amiga normalize  -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/summary/split_merged --over-write --group-by "Plate_ID" --normalize-by "Substrate:None"
```          

<br/>
**Example 2**

Let's say you have a simple experiment with two isolates on two conditions (minimal media or trehalose). Below we show the mapping file that we created and we have already fit the curves for which the summary file was saved as `CD89_wt_summary.txt`. 

||Plate_ID|Isolate|Substrate|Ribotype|Comments|Group|Control|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|A1|CD_treA|CD89_wt|Minimal Media|RT027|Wild-type|1|1|
|A2|CD_treA|CD89_wt|Minimal Media|RT027|Wild-type|1|1|
|A3|CD_treA|CD89_wt|D-Trehalose|RT027|Wild-type|1|0|
|A4|CD_treA|CD89_wt|D-Trehalose|RT027|Wild-type|1|0|
|B1|CD_treA|CD89_ko|Minimal Media|RT027|treA knock-out|2|1|
|B2|CD_treA|CD89_ko|Minimal Media|RT027|treA knock-out|2|1|
|B3|CD_treA|CD89_ko|D-Trehalose|RT027|treA knock-out|2|0|
|B4|CD_treA|CD89_ko|D-Trehalose|RT027|treA knock-out|2|0|

<br/> 

We can adjust the growth paarmeters by simply using the `normalize` function.

```bash
amiga normalize -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/summary/CD89_wt_summary.txt -o "CD89_wt_summary_normalized" --normalize-method "division"
```  
<br />

If we did not expliclty include the `Group` and `Control` columns, we can still normalize the data directly with the command.    


```bash
amiga normalize -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/summary/CD89_wt_summary.txt -o "CD89_wt_summary_normalized" --normalize-method "division" --group-by 'Isolate' --normalize-by 'Substrate:Minimal Media'
```

#### How to normalize parameters from a summary of pooled replicates?

In this example, I have in my working directory (`/Users/firasmidani/experiment/`) multiple data files in the `data` sub-folder . Let us assume that I fit growth curves for replicates pooled across all unique combinations of `Isolate` and `Substrate`.


```bash
amiga fit -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/ -o "pooled_analysis" --pool-by "Isolate,Substrate"
```

<br/>

I can specify that AMiGA should normalize each group (unique combination of `Isolate` and `Substrate`) by their wells where the `Substrate` is also `Negative Control`. In this case, each unique model is specified by an `Isolate` and a `Substrate`. If there are multiple control wells, `AMiGA` will normalize to the mean of their growth parameters.


```bash
amiga normalize -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/summary/pooled_normalized_merged_by_ribotype -o "pooled_normalized_merged_by_ribotype_normalized" --group-by "Isolate,Substrate" --normalize-by "Substrate:Negative Control" 
```

<br />
