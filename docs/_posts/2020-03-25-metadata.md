`AMiGA` can process one or multiple data files in a single command. These data files describe the optical density (or any other unit of measurement) in wells of one or more plates at different time points. `AMiGA` can analyze your data and report its results in a text file where each row is a well and columns correspond to different summary metrics or growth parameters.

If you want to take advantage of several unique features of `AMiGA`, you should also pass meta-data or information about your plates or the specific wells in those plates. This can be done automatically by `AMiGA` if it recognizes that your data corresponds to a specific Biolog PM plate.

In the case of no meta-data available for a plate, the internal mapping file generated by `AMiGA` will look like this:

||Plate_ID|
|:---|:---|
|A1|ER1_PM2-1|
|A2|ER1_PM2-1|
|...|...|
|H11|ER1_PM2-1|
|H12|ER1_PM2-1|

If it however recognizes the plate as a specific Biolog PM, the internal mapping file generated by `AMiGA` will look like this:

||Plate_ID|Isolate|PM|Replicate|Substrate|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|A1|ER1_PM2-1|ER1|2|1|Negative Control|
|A2|ER1_PM2-1|ER1|2|1|Chondroitin Sulfate C|
|...|ER1_PM2-1|ER1|2|1|...|
|H11|ER1_PM2-1|ER1|2|1|2,3-Butanedione|
|H12|ER1_PM2-1|ER1|2|1|2-Hyrdoxy 2-Butanone|
