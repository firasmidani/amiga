To follow along with this example, you will find the necessary files in the `amiga/example` git folder.

**Hypothetical scenario**
<br /><br/>
You are the leading global expert on the human pathogen *Examploides randomii*. Diligent work by your lab has previously analyzed its outbreak in the United States of America (USA) in 1995. One week ago, you received a phone call from Mariana, an epidemiologist in Mexico (MEX). *E. randomii* is emerging in the the state of Yucatán. Mariana has been tracking the outbreak and is wondering if the emerging strain may be related to the 1995 outbreak in USA. She has sent you two clinical isolates of *E. randomii* overnight. You revived two clinical isolates from frozen stocks of the 1995 outbreak. You asked your colleague, Kai, to sequence and compare the genomes of all of the isolate. In the meantime, you profiled the carbon substrate utilization of all isolates using Biolog Phenotype Microarray (PM) plates 1 and 2.
<br /><br/>
**Preparing your data for analysis**
<br /><br/>
You created a working directory in `/home/outbreaks/erandomii` and saved the result from your plate reader in `/home/outbreaks/erandomii/data`.
<br /><br/>
You also created the following table describing your files and saved it as the tab-delimited mapping file `/home/outbreaks/erandomii/mapping/meta.txt`
<br /><br />

**Plotting your data**
<br /><br/>
You are curious about the quality of your results. Is the pathogen growing in at least some of the wells? Is the data noisy? Do you need to repeat any plates?
<br /><br/>
You downloaded `AMiGA` (see Installation) and made sure you are in the correct directory.

```bash
cd /home/programs/amiga
```

You started analyzing your data by simply plotting the files.

```bash
python amiga.py -i /home/outbreaks/erandomii/ --only-basic-summary
```

You found the following files in your `figures` folders:
<br /><br/>
`ER1_PM1-1.pdf`<br/>
`ER1_PM1-2.pdf`<br/>
`ER1_PM2-1.pdf`<br/>
`ER1_PM2-2.pdf`<br/>
`ER2_PM1-1.pdf`<br/>
`ER2_PM1-2.pdf`<br/>
`ER2_PM2-1.pdf`<br/>
`ER2_PM2-2.pdf`<br/>
`ER3_PM1-1.pdf`<br/>
`ER3_PM1-2.pdf`<br/>
`ER3_PM2-1.pdf`<br/>
`ER3_PM2-2.pdf`<br/>
`ER4_PM1-1.pdf`<br/>
`ER4_PM1-2.pdf`<br/>
`ER4_PM2-1.pdf`<br/>
`ER4_PM2-2.pdf`<br/>
<br/>
and the following file sin your `summary` folders:
`ER1_PM1-1.txt`<br/>
`ER1_PM1-2.txt`<br/>
`ER1_PM2-1.txt`<br/>
`ER1_PM2-2.txt`<br/>
`ER2_PM1-1.txt`<br/>
`ER2_PM1-2.txt`<br/>
`ER2_PM2-1.txt`<br/>
`ER2_PM2-2.txt`<br/>
`ER3_PM1-1.txt`<br/>
`ER3_PM1-2.txt`<br/>
`ER3_PM2-1.txt`<br/>
`ER3_PM2-2.txt`<br/>
`ER4_PM1-1.txt`<br/>
`ER4_PM1-2.txt`<br/>
`ER4_PM2-1.txt`<br/>
`ER4_PM2-2.txt`<br/>
<br />
Gladly, all figures look fine. The pathogen seems to be growing in some of the wells in each of the PM1 and PM2 plates. There are some minor difference that you can spot by eye between the Mexican and American isolates. But you will fit the growth curves first to confirm your observations.
<br /><br/>
**Fitting growth curves**

To fit the growth curves, you run the following command. The `--merge-summary` argument will report the results in a single text file with the name passed with the `-o` argument `Biolog_ERandomii`. Fitting growth curves takes about 1 minute per 96-well plate. The full analysis will take about 15 minutes. You added the `--verbose` argument so that `AMiGA` shares in real time more details about the input, data processing, and results.

```bash
python amiga.py -i /home/outbreaks/erandomii --normalize-parameters --merge-summary -o 'Biolog_ERandomii' --verbose
```

The files in your `summary` files were updated to include inferred growth parameters for each well. You looked at these results in your favorite data analysis software (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Python, R, ... etc.). For example, you normalized all of the growth parameters relative to the relevant control well ('A1' in biolog plates) or simply passed the `--normalize-parameters` to `AMiGA` as shown above. Then, you averaged these normalized parameters within each strain. Finally, you plotted the normalized AUC and Growth Rates  as heat-maps and focused on substrates with normalized AUC higher than 1.2.

![amiga directory tree example](../assets/img/heatmaps.png){:width="700px"}

You made the following observations:

- Only the MEX_2020 strain grows on L-Lactic Acid.
- Only the USA_1995 strain grow on Sorbic Acid..
- MEX_2020 strain seems to grow much better on 2-Aminoethanol.
- USA_1995 strain seems to grow much better on D-Sorbitol.
- MEX_2020 strain seems to grow more rapidly on 2-Aminoethanol than USA_1995.
- Capric Acid is toxic to both strains.

<br />

**Simple Hypothesis Testing**

Based on your observations, you formulated several hypothesis. You can test for those quickly with AMiGA. For example, you tested for differential growth on L-Lactic Acid between the two strains using the following command.

```bash
python amiga.py -i /home/outbreaks/erandomii -s "Substrate:L-Lactic Acid" -y "H0:Time;H1:Time+Strain" -o "strain_difference_l_lactic_acid" -np 99 -tss 3
```

This will produce six files in the `strain_difference_l_lactic_acid` folder inside the `models` directory:

- `strain_difference_lactic_acid_key.txt`
- `strain_difference_lactic_acid_input.txt`
- `strain_difference_lactic_acid_params.txt`
- `strain_difference_lactic_acid_log.txt`
- `strain_difference_lactic_acid_report.txt`
- `strain_difference_lactic_acid.pdf`

<br />

The figure will show the models estimated for each strain (bold lines) overlaid on the actual data (thin lines). Shaded bands indicate the 95% confidence interval for the models.

![lactic acid figure](../assets/img/strain_difference_l_lactic_acid.png){:width="400px"}

<br />

The output report will look like this:

```
The following criteria were used to subset data:
Substrate......['L-Lactic Acid']

The following hypothesis was tested on the data:
{'H0': ['Time'], 'H1': ['Time', 'Strain']}

log Bayes Factor: 750.522 (0.0-percentile in null distribution based on 100 permutations)

For P(H1|D) > P(H0|D) and FDR <= 10%, log BF must be > 0.696
For P(H0|D) > P(H1|D) and FDR <= 10%, log BF must be < -0.000

Data Manipulation: Input was reduced to 34 time points. Samples were normalized to relevant control samples before modelling.
```

This indicates that the log Bayes Factor is 750.522 and much higher than the 10% FDR threshold of 0.696. You are every confident that Lactic Acid supports the growth of the MEX_2020 strain but not the USA_1995 strain.

<br />

For an additional illustration of this approach, you tested for differential growth of these strains on `2-Aminoethanol` using the following command:

```bash
python amiga.py -i /home/outbreaks/erandomii -s "Substrate:2-Aminoethanol" -y "H0:Time;H1:Time+Strain" -o "strain_difference_2_aminoethanol" -np 99 -tss 3
```

The log Bayes Factor was 596.183 and much higher than the 10% FDR threshold of 2.176. You are also confident that the MEX_2020 strain has a faster growth rate on 2-aminoethanol than the USA_1995 strain.

![ethanolamine figure](../assets/img/strain_difference_2_aminoethanol.png){:width="400px"}

<br />

As a control, you tested for differential growth on D-Xylose. The above heatmap suggests that there is very little difference in AUC or growth rate between the strains.

![xylose figure](../assets/img/strain_difference_d_xylose.png){:width="400px"}

<br />

There is almost no visual difference of the strain-specific models. The report also shows that the log Bayes Factor is 0.357 and that the 10% FDR threshold is 0.694. Recall, that

$$\text{Bayes Factor} = \exp{\log \text{Bayes Factor}} = \exp{0.357} = 1.43$$

and

$$\text{Bayes Factor} = \frac{P(H1|D)}{P(H0|D)}$$

Therefore, the analysis suggest that alternative hypothesis that strain differences contributes to differences in growth is not more informative than the null hypothesis that only time explains variations in optical density measurements at an FDR set to 10%.
