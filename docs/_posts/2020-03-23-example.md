Hypothetical scenario: You are the leading academic expert on the pathogen *Examploides randomii*. Diligent work by your lab has previously analyze its outbreak in the United States of America (USA) in 1995. One week ago, you received a phone call from Mariana, an epidemiologist in Mexico. *E. randomii* is emerging in the the state of Yucat√°n. Mariana has been tracking the outbreak and is wondering if the emerging strain may be related to the 1995 outbreak in USA. She has sent you two clinical isolates of *E. randomii* overnight. You revived two clinical isolates from frozen stocks of the 1995 outbreak. You asked Kai to prepare sequence the genomes of all of the isolate. In the meantime, you have profiled the carbon substrate utilization of all isolates using Biolog Phenotype Microarray (PM) plates. Here is your tabel of plates.

|Plate_ID|Species|Strain|Isolate|PM|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|ER1_PM1-1|E randomii|USA 1995|ER1|1|
|ER1_PM2-1|E randomii|USA 1995|ER1|2|
|ER2_PM1-1|E randomii|USA 1995|ER2|1|
|ER2_PM2-1|E randomii|USA 1995|ER2|2|
|ER3_PM1-1|E randomii|MEX 2020|ER3|1|
|ER3_PM2-1|E randomii|MEX 2020|ER3|2|
|ER4_PM1-1|E randomii|MEX 2020|ER4|1|
|ER4_PM2-1|E randomii|MEX 2020|ER4|2|
