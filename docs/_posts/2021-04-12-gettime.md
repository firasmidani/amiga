In your analysis, you may be interested in detecting the time at which growth curves reach a certain OD threshold. The `get_time` functions can detect these time intervals from the predicted growth curves. Let's say that you fit a Biolog PM plate with `AMiGA`. 

<br />

```bash
amiga fit -i /home/outbreaks/erandomii/ER1_PM2-1.txt --save-gp-data
```

<br />

Here, the `--save-gp-data` will save a file that includes the growth curves and various variations of it. See [`Command-line interface`](\amiga\doc\command-line-interface.html) for more details. It will include for example a column titled `OD_Growth_Fit` which is the predicted log growth converted back real OD but still baseline-corrected (i.e. first measurement is approximately zero).

<br />

Let's say that you are interested in find out when does the growth curve in each well reach an OD of 0.5. The `get_time` can do this with the following. 

<br />

```bash
amiga get_time --gp-data /home/outbreaks/erandomii/gp_Data/ER1_PM2-1_gp_data.txt --summary /home/outbreaks/erandomii/summary/ER1_PM2-1_summary.txt --threshold 0.5 --curve-format OD_Growth_Fit 
```

<br />

Here, we asked `AMiGA` to find out when does the `OD_Growth_Fit` for each curve reaches an OD of `0.5`. To do this, we needed to point `AMiGA` to both the file that contains `OD_Growth_Fit` and the `summary` file which contains meta-data. `AMiGA` will then update the `summary` file to include a new column `t_od(0.5)` which indicate the time needed to reach OD of 0.5. If the growth curves started at OD higher than 0.5, then the value will be zero. If the growth curve never reaches an OD of 0.5, the the value will be `inf` or infinity.

#### Command-line arguments

To see the full list of arguments that `amiga compare` will accept, run

```bash
amiga get-time --help
```
which will return the following message

```bash
usage: amiga [-h] --gp-data GP_DATA --summary SUMMARY --threshold THRESHOLD
             [--curve-format {OD_Data,OD_Fit,GP_Input,GP_Output,OD_Growth_Fit,OD_Growth_Data,GP_Derivative}]

Get time at which OD reaches a certain value

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --gp-data GP_DATA
  --summary SUMMARY
  --threshold THRESHOLD
  --curve-format {OD_Data,OD_Fit,GP_Input,GP_Output,OD_Growth_Fit,OD_Growth_Data,GP_Derivative}
```

<br/>
See more details for these arguments in [Command Line Interface](/amiga/doc/command-line-interface.html)
