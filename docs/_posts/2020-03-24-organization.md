Before you begin with your first analysis, you need to create a folder which will refer to as the __Working Directory__. Here, I name my example as __experiment__. In this folder, you must have a __data__ sub-folder where you will save all of your data files that need to be analyzed.

<br /><br />

![amiga directory tree example](../assets/img/amiga_directory_tree_simple.png){:width="500px"}
<!--- ![amiga directory tree example](../assets/img/amiga_directory_tree_simple.png){:class="img-responsive"} --->

<br /><br />

Your data should look something like this

<br /><br />

![amiga directory tree example](../assets/img/example_data_file){:width="500px"}
<!--- ![amiga directory tree example](../assets/img/amiga_directory_tree_simple.png){:class="img-responsive"} --->
